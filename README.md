# Problem Statement
An ad-tech company recently introduced a new impression bidding model for their online advertising campaigns, Average Bidding, as an alternative to their existing bidding model, Maximum Bidding.

Regina Corporation, a client running a retargeting advertising campaign using the Maximum Bidding model, has decided to test this new bidding model and wants to conduct an A/B test to understand if Average Bidding performs better than Maximum Bidding.

# What is A/B testing?
A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better. It's a way to measure the impact of changes to a webpage or app, such as changes to design, content, or functionality.

Here's a basic outline of how A/B testing typically works:

Hypothesis: Start with a hypothesis. This is a statement that suggests a change will lead to a specific outcome. For example, "Changing the color of the 'Buy Now' button to green will increase the conversion rate."

Control and Treatment Groups: You have two groups: the control group and the treatment group. The control group sees the original version (unchanged), while the treatment group sees the version with the change you're testing.

Randomization: It's important to randomly assign users to these groups to ensure that any differences in outcomes are due to the changes you made and not some other factor.

Collect Data: Track relevant metrics (e.g., conversion rate, click-through rate, etc.) for both groups. This could involve using tools like Google Analytics.

Statistical Analysis: Use statistical analysis to determine if there's a significant difference in performance between the control and treatment groups.

Draw Conclusions: Based on the data, you can draw conclusions about whether the change had a positive, negative, or neutral impact.

Implement and Monitor: If the treatment group outperforms the control group, you might choose to implement the change. However, it's important to continue monitoring performance to ensure that the results hold over time.
