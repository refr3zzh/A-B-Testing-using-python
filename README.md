An ad-tech company recently introduced a new impression bidding model for their online advertising campaigns, Average Bidding, as an alternative to their existing bidding model, Maximum Bidding.

Regina Corporation, a client running a retargeting advertising campaign using the Maximum Bidding model, has decided to test this new bidding model and wants to conduct an A/B test to understand if Average Bidding performs better than Maximum Bidding.
